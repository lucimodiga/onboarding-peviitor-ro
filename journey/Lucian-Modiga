Hi! I'm Lucian Modiga. I'm searching to be UI/UX Designer. I developed my design skills in my current company and on my own while studying about this. 
I'm currently enrolled in an UI/UX Design course at Webcase to get more experience.
I want to work more with Figma and get more experience with similar tools.
A friend told me about this opportunity and I couldn't miss it.
